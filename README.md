# Rules & Tools

## About this repo

When you work with a team, you have to define some rules and coding styles so that everyone can code happily altogether. There will be no fight about the identation method (spaces vs tabs), the space between `if` and the `(condition)`, the way variables are named and so on.

So here we go ! Short and not so short descriptions and how-to's about the rules and tools used by the Leka team.

## Coding styles and rules

>***One does not simply start coding with Leka.***

If you want to help us and code in one of the following languages, you must follow the rules:

*	[C++ coding rules](/languages/cpp.md)

## The Git way of life

Before starting coding with Leka, you must know how to use `git` in an efficient and elegant way.

We use `git` the same way [Vincent Driessen](https://twitter.com/nvie) does, so we urge you to read his beautiful and [Successful Git branchin model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

If you want to work with us, you'll be tested on the subject! ;)
