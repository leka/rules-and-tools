# Rules & Tools

## About this repo

When a team works on a project, it is important to define rules and coding styles. By doing do, you allow anyone to code happily with one another.

Rules are made so that there will be no fight about things like:

*	the identation method (spaces vs tabs)
*	the space between `if` and the `(condition)`
*	the way variables are named
*	and so on...

So here we go ! Short and not so short descriptions, how-to's, rules and tools used by the Leka team.

## The Git way of life

Before starting coding with Leka, you must know how to use `git` in an efficient and elegant way.

We use `git` the same way [Vincent Driessen](https://twitter.com/nvie) does, so we urge you to read his beautiful and [Successful Git branchin model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

If you want to work with us, prepare to be tested on the subject! ;)

## Coding styles and rules

>***One does not simply start coding with Leka.***

### .editorconfig

To make sure basic rules like `tabs` are followed, we've made an `.editorconfig` that you can download [here]().

Or 

### Languages

From experience and preference, we've bring those rules to your acquaintance:

*	[C++ coding rules](/languages/cpp.md)
*	[Markdown Pandoc rules](/languages/markdown.md)

## The perfect toolbox

### Markdown & Pandoc

At Leka we use markdown for pretty much everything. Its simplicity and beauty combined with the power of `pandoc` makes the perfect productivity tool.
