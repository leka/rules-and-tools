## Introduction

### Why rules?

This document defines the different coding rules anyone must respect when writing `C++` code at [Leka](http://weareleka.com).

The rules are based upon wildly used standards, several personal experiences, different sources and needs.

There are several reasons for using coding rules:

*  **harmony**: all Leka's projects will follow the same coding rules and styles
*  **readability**: consistency makes the code easier to read
*  **usability**: consistency makes the code easier to use
*  **improvability**: consistency makes the code easier to modify and update
*  **debuggability**: consistency makes the code easier to debug

This document is only here to define the coding style to adopt, it does not contain any technical recommendations.

>So why should one abide by those rules whereas modern IDE already improve readability with syntax coloring, navigation, etc.?

The source code should always be considered outside the development environment and should be written in a way that improves readability in any environment. By doing so, members of the team are allowed to use the tools they prefer for efficient and comfortable coding.

### Rules definitions

Rules are numbered and will be shown as follow:

####n. Directive

```
Code example if possible.
```

Why/Motivation and additional information.

### Rules hierarchy

In the directive part, verbs like **must**, **should** and **can**, all have specific meanings. A directive with **must**, must be used, a directive with **should**, is highly recommended, and a directive with **can**, is a general directive.

## General Rules

#### 1. Any non-compliance is permitted if it allows for better readability. 

```
Code example if possible.
```

The main purpose of these rules is to improve readability and thus the understanding, maintainability and the general quality of the code. It is not possible to cover all the specific cases in this document and the developer must be flexible.
